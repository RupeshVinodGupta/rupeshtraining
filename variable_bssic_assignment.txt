Q1. Write all the conventions being followed while declaring a variable.

ans:-
1)Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore. They cannot start with a number.

2)Variable names should consist of only letters, numbers, and underscores. They cannot contain spaces or other special characters.

3)Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful. They should represent what the variable is used for.

4)Variable names should be lowercase, except for constants, which are usually written in all uppercase.

5)If a variable name consists of multiple words, they should be separated by underscores, e.g., "my_variable_name".

6)Variables that represent private or internal data should be preceded by a single underscore, e.g., "_my_private_variable".

7)Variables that are intended to be used as constants should be written in all uppercase, e.g., "MY_CONSTANT".
